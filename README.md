# Implement React Router DOM:

Utilize React Router DOM to create a seamless and dynamic browsing experience, allowing users to navigate between different pages and components within your website.

# Authentication with Firebase:

Employ Firebase authentication to enable secure user registration, login, and session management. Implement email/password authentication, as well as social login options like Google or Facebook.

# User Types and Dashboards:

Create three user types - admin, instructors, and students - each with their respective dashboards. Customize the dashboards to provide relevant information and functionalities based on the user type, such as managing classes for instructors, enrollment details for students, and administrative tasks for admins.

# Secure Payment Integration:

Integrate a secure payment system, such as Stripe, to enable students to make payments for enrolling in specific tutor's classes. Implement JWT token-based authentication to ensure secure and authorized transactions. Consider incorporating a payment confirmation feature and providing receipts for successful transactions.
